 I am currently trying to finish a Software Engineer bootcamp where, among others, I have worked in Python, Django, SQL and MySQlite.
I am looking to find a Software Engineer job once I finish the course.

Please do not hesitate to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasa7/) for further information.
